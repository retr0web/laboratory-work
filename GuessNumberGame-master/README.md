# GuessNumberGame
In this game you've got to choose a number between 1 and 3 (including 1 and 3).

You have 50 Hp at the start.

Each time you guess correctly you get 5 XP points.

Your starting lvl is 1 and to earn a higher you must collect XP that is higher than 5+n^2, where n is number of your level.

If you guess incorrectly, you lose 1 HP and 5 XP.

Obviously, if your HP equals zero you lose :(

Now guess how many times you will survive?

Enjoy!
